Time for another Ludum Dare game jam, where game devs over the world gather and make a game over the weekend!

This month's Ludum Dare 33 is our 6th time joining the online game development competition. The theme was "You are the monster," and this is what Dave and I came up with over the 72-hour game jam.

_Necromorph_ is an action platformer game where you kill monsters and steal their identity – you become the last monster you killed and steal their abilities and appearance.

<p class="img-caption text-center">Kill monsters, become the monster.</p>

There are three types of enemy units in the game: the melee knight, the archer, and the gargoyle, each with their own abilities and stats. The knight for example is heavy and slow but has high attack power. Archers are light and fast but needs two arrows to take down the knight.

There's a total of 3 levels, the first being a tutorial level inspired by genius tutorial levels in games like Super Mario Bros. and Cave Story.

I shall be making a post-mortem blog post where I will talk more about our thought process on designing the levels, as well as how the game fared on the game jam, so stay tuned! Meanwhile, go play Necromorph!
