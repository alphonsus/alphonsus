# Tools

*Last updated: January 15, 2017*

Here is a list of tools and resources I use for making games.

&nbsp;

### Game Development

- [LÖVE][love] — An open-source game framework for making 2D games using the awesome Lua scripting language.
- [HaxeFlixel][haxeflixel] – A complete game development toolkit. Basically, it is Haxe programming language + OpenFL + Flixel game framework.
- [Unity][unity] – Used to be my main game engine, but switched to HaxeFlixel very recently.
- [Sublime Text 3][sublimetext] – Code-editor. I prefer a lightweight lightning fast text editor over feature-packed but slow IDE's any day. You just need to get used to keyboard shortcuts and install the necessary packages.
- [Tiled][tiled] – Tiled map level editor. I usually export the levels into CSV/Lua files which are then fed into whicever game engine I'm using.

### Art

- [Pyxel Edit][pyxeledit] – In-game pixel art sprites.
- [Photoshop][photoshop] – Non in-game stuff, like making game title banners for marketing.

&nbsp;

### Project Management
- [Git][git] – Version control system.
- [GitHub][github] – Git repository host.
- [iTerm 2][iterm2] – My terminal where I do version control with Git or compile Haxe projects among many other UNIX-related tasks.
- [Trello][trello] – Used as a "kanban" board typically with three columns: "Todo", "In Progress", and "Done." We also label the tasks using color labels, i.e. green for feature, orange for art-related stuff, red for bugs, etc.
- [Slack][slack] – The best app for communication. It's more than just an IM app – we integrated it with GitHub so pushing to remote repositories will ping a notification to everyone in the chat room. We also use this to share images and screenshots which you can "pin" for quick references later.

### Audio

- [BFXR][bfxr] – Chiptune sound effects.
- [FreeMusicArchive][freemusicarchive] - Where I look for free background music for our games.
- [LMMS][lmms] – Open source digital audio workstation.
